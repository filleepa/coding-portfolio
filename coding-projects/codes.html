        <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>

        <h2>The Beginning</h2>
        <p>Like many people, I properly began experimentin with coding during the COVID-19 pandemic. After taking a few online courses, I felt comfortable enough to try some basic data analysis and data science methods on data sets from sites like Kaggle.</p>

        <h2>Coding Projects</h2>
        <p>Below are the various small projects I've done over the years. Most are simple data analysis and machine learning projects.</p>
