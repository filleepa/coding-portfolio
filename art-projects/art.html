        <h1>My Art Journey</h1>

        <h2>The 2000s</h2>
        <p>I don't have too many records of my art from this time period, but I did develop a passion for art early in life. Much of my art exists in long lost sketchbooks or between the margin lines of homework paper. Around this time, like many kids, I was enraptured with the characters and worlds within cartoons and video games, and I attempted to recapture their magic in my own amateur art. I even had a DeviantArt account where I'd post much of my art, but I sadly deleted the account and most of my early art is now lost media (a recurring theme with my art).</p>

        <h2>Early 2010s</h2>
        <p>My art begun to improve as I gained more interests in a diverse range of media. Beyond just cartoons and video games, I also began to read comics, both physical and digital. One prominent piece of media that exposed me to a wide range of artists and styles was Homestuck (please reserve judgement). It was one of my earliest introductions to the concept of fanart and fan work, which would have a profound influence on my art journey.</p>

        <h2>Late 2010s</h2>
        <p>This is where I delved deep into online fan communities, creating and sharing art for IPs that I was passionate about and gaining a small following, and where my art saw its biggest improvement. I was mostly sequestered to Tumblr, but I had the unfortunate habit of deleting my blogs once I gained too may followers. Some of my art is lost to time as I didn't think to archive some of it on a harddrive or on the cloud.</p>

        <h2>The 2020s</h2>
        <p>I unfortunately didn't have as much time during these past few years for art, but recently I've been rekindling my passion for it.</p>
